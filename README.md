# MemeMe 1.0

This repository contains the Udacity project **MemeMe 1.0** from the iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

This Swift iOS application allows users to pick an image to use as the basis of a meme (either from their photos or from the device camera). Users can then edit TextFields at the top and bottom of the image using a meme-style typeface. When editing the lower TextField the image moves up so it is not blocked by the keyboard. Finally, users can share the finished meme image.

## Setup

There are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
